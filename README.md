# GameOfLife

===================================================================================================================================

Currently set up to display a 25x25 randomized grid of characters that are either '-' or 'O' based on the cell being alive or dead.
Examples of classic Conway shapes are also included as options within the code, for testing purposes.

To display one of the test examples instead, modify GameOfLife.py line #151 from "ex_grid = rand_grid" to "ex_grid = <grid_name>",
where <grid_name> is "block", "beehive", "loaf", "boat", "tub", "blinker", "tub", "beacon", etc.
